### Question :  
Write a function that takes an **integer (0 to 20)** and returns its **factorial**.  
The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers between 1 and the given number.  
The factorial of zero is defined as **1**.  

### Conditions :  
- Input will always be an integer from **0 to 20**.  
- Return the **factorial** of the given number.  

### Test Cases :  

**Sr. No.** | **Function Call**         | **Expected Output**  
--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------  
1       | `factorial(0)`                | `1`  
2       | `factorial(5)`                | `120`  
3       | `factorial(20)`               | `2432902008176640000`
