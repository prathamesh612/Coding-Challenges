# Nth Prime

### Question:
Given a **positive integer n**, return the **nth prime number**.

A **prime number** is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

### Examples:
```
Prime sequence: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...

n = 1 → 1st prime → 2
n = 5 → 5th prime → 11
n = 10 → 10th prime → 29
```

### Test Cases:
| **Sr. No.** | **Function Call** | **Expected Output** |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| 1           | `nthPrime(5)`     | `11`                |
| 2           | `nthPrime(10)`    | `29`                |
| 3           | `nthPrime(16)`    | `53`                |
| 4           | `nthPrime(99)`    | `523`               |
| 5           | `nthPrime(1000)`  | `7919`              |
